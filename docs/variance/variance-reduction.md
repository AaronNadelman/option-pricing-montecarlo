# Variance Reduction

Techniques such as antithetic variates, control variates, and quasi-Monte Carlo reduce simulation noise, giving more accurate estimates with fewer runs.


## Quasi-Monte Carlo (Sobol)
In addition to classical variance reduction, the project offers quasi-random sampling.

**Run the example:**
```bash
python examples/example_quasi_mc.py
```
